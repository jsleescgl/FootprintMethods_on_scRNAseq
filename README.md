## Robustness and applicability of transcription factor and pathway analysis tools on single-cell RNA-seq data

### Abstract

**Background**

Many functional analysis tools have been developed to extract functional and mechanistic insight from bulk transcriptome data. With the advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), it is in principle possible to do such an analysis for single cells. However, scRNA-seq data has characteristics such as drop-out events and low library sizes. It is thus not clear if functional TF and pathway analysis tools established for bulk sequencing can be applied to scRNA-seq in a meaningful way.

**Results**

To address this question, we perform benchmark studies on simulated and real scRNA-seq data. We include the bulk-RNA tools PROGENy, GO enrichment, and DoRothEA that estimate pathway and transcription factor (TF) activities, respectively, and compare them against the tools SCENIC/AUCell and metaVIPER, designed for scRNA-seq. For the in silico study, we simulate single cells from TF/pathway perturbation bulk RNA-seq experiments. We complement the simulated data with real scRNA-seq data upon CRISPR-mediated knock-out. Our benchmarks on simulated and real data reveal comparable performance to the original bulk data. Additionally, we show that the TF and pathway activities preserve cell type-specific variability by analyzing a mixture sample sequenced with 13 scRNA-seq protocols. We also provide the benchmark data for further use by the community.

**Conclusions**

Our analyses suggest that bulk-based functional analysis tools that use manually curated footprint gene sets can be applied to scRNA-seq data, partially outperforming dedicated single-cell tools. Furthermore, we find that the performance of functional analysis tools is more sensitive to the gene sets than to the statistic used.

### Availabilty of data
The datasets supporting the conclusions of this publication are available at Zenodo:

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3564179.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3564179)

From Zenodo you can download these (zipped) folders: 

 * `data` - Contains raw data for the analyses
 * `output` - Contains intermediate and final results
 
 Please deposit the unzipped folders in the root directory of this R-project.
 
 **Exceptions:**
 
 * The raw Human Cell Atlas data ([`"data/hca_data/expression_data/sce.all.technologies.RData"`](https://github.com/saezlab/FootprintMethods_on_scRNAseq/blob/master/analyses/hca_data_analysis.Rmd#L56)) are not available on Zenodo. Instead the users can work with the normalized data stored in [`"output/hca_data/expression/norm.rds"`](https://github.com/saezlab/FootprintMethods_on_scRNAseq/blob/master/analyses/hca_data_analysis.Rmd#L205). The raw data are accessible on GEO: [GSE133549](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE133549).
 * Only a small fraction of the raw and normalized expression data of the simulated single cells are  avaiable. All data together exceed the limitation of Zenodo's maximal upload size.
